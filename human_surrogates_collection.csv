Researchers tested the effect of anonymous avatar use in audio/visual communication to determine if avatar implementation would enhance communication effectiveness. Levels of avatar realism (static/dynami, high or low visual fidelity) and anonymity were manipulated. Participants were told a hypothetical situation indicating that their avatar could be a potential rommate and were encouraged to engage in conversation with them. Participants' perception of copresence was recorded. ",Avatar,No,"Participants perceived mobile devices whose avatars had higher kinetic conformity as socially richer platforms. Participants' interactive satisfaction with their technological communication positively correlated with anthropomorphism of the avatar used. Participants rated the social copresence of mobile devices whose avatars were highly anonymous lower than those with less anonymous avatars.

The goal of the study was to successfully use these agents to reduce young women's negativity and feelings of low self-efficacy in beliefs about engineering. One experiment compared the impact of the agent's voice alone with the impact of the agent's visual model alone to determine the most effective medium in influencing beliefs. A second experiment compared the influence of the agent's different physical characteristics. All participants in the second study interacted with a physical model that did not have a voice. ,Agent,No,"The agent presented as a visual medium had a greater impact than the agent with voice alone on influencing young women's beliefs about self-efficacy in engineering.
